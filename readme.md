A 5-day weather forecast for Perth, written in AngularJS. This was an afternoon project in order to begin learning AngularJS. The data is pulled from Yahoo's API, with a custom directive to display the data.

There's no styling. Perhaps I'll come back to that in future, but it's not a priority right now.
